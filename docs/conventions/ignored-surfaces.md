# Ignored Surfaces

This repository keeps generated artifacts out of static analysis and formatting
checks so the checks stay focused on source files and hand-written docs.

## Generated registry outputs

- `dist/`: TypeScript build output. ESLint and Prettier ignore it because the
  source of truth is `scripts/**/*.ts` and `tests/**/*.ts`.
- `_site/`: local static-site output for GitHub Pages-style previews. It is
  generated from registry content and should not be linted or formatted.
- `registry/`: local registry output/work area used by publishing and rebuild
  workflows. Packuments and tarballs under this directory are generated data.
- `*.tgz`: npm tarballs. Prettier ignores them because they are binary package
  artifacts.

## Dependency installs

- `node_modules/`: dependency install tree. Standard generated dependency
  surface; excluded from all source checks.

## Local tool state

`.gitignore` also excludes local npm cache, editor settings, OS files, swap
files, and agent memory directories. These are workstation-specific state, not
repo source.
