# pdomain-index-npm

Self-hosted [npm registry](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/main/docs/REGISTRY-API.md)
for the `@pdomain/*` scope, served as a static site from GitHub
Pages. The npm sibling of the existing [`pdomain-index-pip`](https://github.com/pdomain/pdomain-index-pip)
Python package index.

## URL

```
https://pdomain.github.io/pdomain-index-npm/
```

## How consumers use it

Add to your project's `.npmrc`:

```
@pdomain:registry=https://pdomain.github.io/pdomain-index-npm/
```

Then:

```sh
npm install @pdomain/pdomain-ui
```

Resolves through the static registry. Every other package continues to
resolve from npmjs.org. The registry is **read-only and unauthenticated**
— no token, no `npm login` required.

## How publishers push to it

Publisher repos trigger a `repository_dispatch` of type `pd-npm-publish`
with a `client_payload.tarball_url` pointing at the `.tgz` (typically a
GitHub Release asset URL on the publisher's own repo):

```sh
gh api repos/pdomain/pdomain-index-npm/dispatches \
  -f event_type=pd-npm-publish \
  -f client_payload[tarball_url]="https://github.com/pdomain/pdomain-ui/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/pdomain-ui-0.1.0-alpha.tgz"
```

The publish workflow downloads the tarball, computes integrity + shasum,
writes it to the `gh-pages` branch, updates the package's packument, and
commits. GitHub Pages picks up the new content within ~60s.

The dispatch path is the fast path. A daily GitHub Actions sync also scans
publisher GitHub Releases for `.tgz` assets and republishes them idempotently,
so the registry catches up if a publisher dispatch is missed.

## Versioning conventions

- Semver throughout.
- Pre-1.0 incubation: `0.X.Y-alpha[.N]`. The `alpha` dist-tag tracks the
  latest prerelease; `latest` only advances when a non-prerelease is
  published.
- Versions are immutable. Republishing the same `name@version` with
  different tarball bytes is rejected by `scripts/publish.ts`.

## Layout

See [docs/REGISTRY_FORMAT.md](docs/REGISTRY_FORMAT.md) for the on-disk
shape and the parts of the npm registry HTTP API we serve.

## Why not just publish to npmjs.org?

Same answer as the pip side. The index speaks the same wire protocol
npmjs does, so migration later is `npm publish` + dropping the `.npmrc`
line. No package-shape changes required.

The `@pdomain/*` packages already follow habits to keep that door
open:

- Plain semver version strings (no npm-specific metadata in the version).
- Release versions are immutable (same `name@version` with different bytes
  is rejected).
- Tarball names follow the `<name>-<version>.tgz` convention npm itself uses.
